**Overview**
The HTML Analyzer Web Application is a dynamic tool designed to enhance the accessibility of web content. Utilizing the latest AI technology, this innovative application examines HTML files, pinpoints areas where Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) compliance can be improved, and automatically refines the code to meet these standards.





**Features**

File Upload Capability: Users can upload HTML files directly through a user-friendly interface.
Automated Analysis: The app leverages a sophisticated back-end, powered by LangChain and OpenAI, to analyze the HTML structure.
WCAG Compliance Enhancement: It updates the HTML content, ensuring alt attributes, color contrasts, and heading levels conform to accessibility standards.
Summary of Changes: A detailed summary of the changes is provided, explaining how each edit contributes to WCAG compliance.
Before and After Preview: Users can view their original HTML code side by side with the improved version, providing clear insight into the enhancements made.




**Technology Stack**

Front-End: Developed with React.js, the front-end offers a modern and responsive user experience.

Back-End: Utilizes Flask to handle file uploads and serve the processed HTML content.

AI Processing: Employs LangChain AI and OpenAI's GPT models to intelligently analyze and modify HTML files.

**Setup and Installation**

To set up the HTML Analyzer Web Application on your local machine, you'll need to have Node.js, npm (Node Package Manager), and Python installed. Follow the instructions in the installation guide to install dependencies, run the Flask server, and launch the React front-end.




**Usage**
